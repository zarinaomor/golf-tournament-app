# ParTee
Created by: Zarina Omor, Reed MacDonald, & Kaitlin Park

We created ParTee with the intention of bringing users together through a common interest... golf! Once a user registers with us they are able to host and join groups to network, improve their game, or to just find a buddy to play a round with.

### Wireframes and Team Brainstorm
![App Blueprint](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parkaitlin/golf-tournament-app/master/wireframes/Image%20from%20iOS.jpg)

The Home view page serves as the first page the user encounters and the foundation for all of other pages.

The User required the following view pages:
1. A "new" page to create or "register" a new user based on our User Model
2. A "show" page that displays the current user's information and serves as a dashboard to keep track of the partees or events that they have hosted or signed up for.
3. An "edit" page to serve as a profile settings page. The user can edit their profile and delete their account.

For the Partees or Group events we included:
1. A host page to create a new event based on our Event Model
2. An index page to display all of the available events sorted by the event's date.
3. A "show" page to display all of the detail for a single event.
